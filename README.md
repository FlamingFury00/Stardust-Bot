# Stardust - A Rocket League Bot

Initially started as a project to learn Python through the SkillQuest course, now i am developing further more on my own to partecipate in the RlBot Championship and other Tournaments.
I am planning to rewrite the entire project, improving strategy, logic, mechanics, math, and other things to try to create the best possible hardcoded bot i can do using GoslingUtils.

**I am in the phase of planning things and soon i will start working on it** (i've already partially started, trying to switch the PD to a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) approach to control better the car, 
but not so successful in the tests...).
